# Purchase Order Tracker (ASP.NET Core + Angular)

Purchase Order Tracker is a line-of-business system used to track the delivery of purchase orders.

You can maintain **Suppliers** and their **Products**, create **Purchase Orders** with **Line Items**, and assign orders to **Shipments**.

## Purpose

The purpose of building this system is to teach myself more about the technologies used, not to release it as a real product.
